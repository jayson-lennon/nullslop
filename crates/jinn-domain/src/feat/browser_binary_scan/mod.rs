//! Browser binary scan actor — verifies the configured browser binary at startup.
//!
//! Runs once on [`EnvironmentLoaded`] (program start only, not per-session,
//! unlike [`SkillsScanActor`](crate::feat::skills::skills_scan_actor::SkillsScanActor)).
//! It resolves the configured [`BrowserBinary`] via [`resolve_browser_binary`]
//! and publishes the result on the bus.
//!
//! ## Why events, not direct dashboard writes
//!
//! `frontend.dashboard` is sole-owned by
//! [`DashboardActor`](crate::feat::dashboard::dashboard_actor::DashboardActor).
//! To honour the per-sub-struct ownership rule, this actor does **not** write
//! to the dashboard. It publishes a generic
//! [`ServiceStatusUpdate`](crate::feat::dashboard::ServiceStatusUpdate)
//! carrying the display label alongside [`BrowserBinaryVerified`] (the domain
//! fact); the dashboard owner applies it to the `web-fetch` row.
